= Architecture

Kroki has a modular architecture and provides multiple components:

Gateway Server::
This component is the entry point of Kroki.
The server is using _Vert.x_ and will route the request to different services.

Blockdiag::
A companion web server written in Python (powered by _Flask_ and _Gunicorn_) that provides _BlockDiag_, _SeqDiag_, _ActDiag_ and _NwDiag_ diagrams libraries.

Mermaid::
A companion web server written in JavaScript (powered by _micro_) that provides _Mermaid_ diagram library.

BPMN::
A companion web server written in JavaScript (powered by _micro_) that provides _bpmn-js_ to render bpmn diagrams.
