=== Convert plain text diagrams to images !

Kroki provides a unified HTTP API with support for BlockDiag (BlockDiag, SeqDiag, ActDiag, NwDiag, PacketDiag, RackDiag), BPMN, Bytefield, C4 (with PlantUML), Ditaa, Erd, Excalidraw, GraphViz, Mermaid, Nomnoml, PlantUML, SvgBob, UMLet, Vega, Vega-Lite and WaveDrom... and more to come!

Kroki is available as a Self-Managed instance. +
We are also _actively_ looking for sponsors to provide Kroki as a free service:

Self-Managed::
Select this option if you want to download and install Kroki on your own infrastructure or in our public cloud environment. +
Please refer to the xref:setup:install.adoc[documentation] to install Kroki.

Free service::
Thanks to {uri-exoscale}[Exoscale], which has kindly offered two servers, we can provide Kroki as a _free service_! +
However, some parts of the infrastructure are still host on other providers, so *we are still looking for sponsors to cover all the expenses*.
+
If you are interested, please ðŸ‘‹ mailto:hello@kroki.io[contact us].

The public instance of Kroki does not do any remote call for performance/security reasons. Also we want to keep the API as simple as possible, so it takes a text diagram as input and returns an image.
If you want to generate diagrams directly from a public source file, check this other project named {uri-diagramit}[Diagram it] that was built upon Kroki and allow you to generate the diagram only by providing the diagram's public source file path.
